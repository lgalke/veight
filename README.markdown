# Veight

Fresh and clean vim setup, motivated by recent Vim8 release.

## Structure
  - pack/core/start : Modifies vim at its core functionalities, or plugins without competetive alternative. 
  - pack/core/opt   : Optional core plugins
  - pack/extra/start : Does not fit in core, or filetype specific
  - pack/extra/opt : Dynamic alternatives (such as completion, snippets)
  - pack/community/start : Aesthetics and stuff
  - pack/community/opt : Here are the color schemes
  - pack/testing/start : Highly volatile Plugins
  - pack/testing/opt : Even more volatile Plugins
