# Veight

Fresh and clean vim setup, motivated by recent Vim8 release.

## Structure
- vim : Base directory for plugins and vimrc. Link this to `~/.vim`
- vim/community : Mostly filetype specific.
- vim/extra : Mainly aesthetics and convenience
- vim/core : Core functionalities
- vim/testing : Highly volatile plugins, potentially including my own.
- vim/vimrc : The configuration file.
